The RMS Titanic crash is one of the most infamous and deadliest shipwrecks in history. On the 5th night of its maiden voyage in April 1912, the Titanic, the largest steamship ever built, crashed into an iceberg and sank into the cool waters of the North Atlantic Sea, due to the crack opened in the ship's hull. Along with him, 2224 passengers and 1502 crew members were involved in the biggest shipwreck in history. This tragic accident had an international impact and led to better safety regulations for ships.  One of the biggest reasons why the incident caused so many casualties was that there were not enough lifeboats in the ship inventory for passengers and crew before anchoring in Southampton port. The limited number of lifeboats on board also caused some class discrimination to be a determining factor in the survival of the passengers after the accident. That is, some groups of people, such as women, children, and the upper class, were more likely to survive than others.  The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers on board the RMS Titanic and those involved in the wreckage of the Titanic after the accident.
